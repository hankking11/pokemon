    !!!!Welcome to Pokemon Black-And-White Version!!!! 
-----------------------------------------------------------
Rated T for Teen
You get to play as Ash's pidgeot. 
Today, Ash is out fighting the Elite Four. But he forgot his best 
pokemon (Thats you!). What's worse is that when Ash was out on the 
town last night, he left his items all over the region!!! He can't 
remember where he left them, and  he can't win without them. Your job 
is to gather his items and bring them to him before he is defeated! 
you have 250  moves or actions before you use up all your strength 
and faint.
Without you ash will surely lose! (He's not feeling very well this 
morning) To win you need all 12 items.
